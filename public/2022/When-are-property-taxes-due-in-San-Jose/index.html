        <h1 id="When-are-property-taxes-due-in-San-Jose"><a href="#When-are-property-taxes-due-in-San-Jose" class="headerlink" title="When are property taxes due in San Jose?"></a>When are property taxes due in San Jose?</h1><p>The San Jose property tax deadline is December 10. If you pay after December 10, you will be charged a penalty and interest.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-I-pay-my-property-taxes-in-San-Jose"><a href="#How-can-I-pay-my-property-taxes-in-San-Jose" class="headerlink" title="How can I pay my property taxes in San Jose?"></a>How can I pay my property taxes in San Jose?</h1><p>Residents of San Jose who need to pay their property taxes can do so in a few ways.</p>
<p>One option is to go online and use the City of San Jose’s e-Pay portal. This portal allows you to pay your taxes online with a credit or debit card. You can also use the portal to set up automatic payments for your taxes.</p>
<p>Another option is to pay your taxes in person at the San Jose Tax Collector’s office. The office is located at 200 E. Santa Clara Street, and it is open from 8:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday. You can also pay your taxes by mail. The mailing address is P.O. Box 48066, San Jose, CA 95148-8066.</p>
<p>Be sure to include your payment stub with your payment if you are mailing it in. Payments without a stub may not be processed correctly.</p>
<p>There are a variety of payment methods that you can use to pay your property taxes in San Jose, including cash, check, money order, and debit or credit card. For more information on how to pay your property taxes, visit the San Jose Tax Collector’s website.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-penalties-for-not-paying-property-taxes-in-San-Jose"><a href="#What-are-the-penalties-for-not-paying-property-taxes-in-San-Jose" class="headerlink" title="What are the penalties for not paying property taxes in San Jose?"></a>What are the penalties for not paying property taxes in San Jose?</h1><p>If you do not pay your San Jose property taxes, the penalties can be steep. The City of San Jose imposes a 1.5% interest penalty on any unpaid balance, and also assesses a $25 administrative fee. In total, the city can charge up to 18% in penalties and fees on top of the amount you owe in property taxes.</p>
<p>In addition, the Santa Clara County Treasurer has the power to sell your property at a public auction if you fall behind on your payments. The last thing you want is for your home or business to be auctioned off to the highest bidder because you didn’t pay your taxes on time!</p>
<p>It’s important to stay on top of your San Jose property taxes so you don’t have to face these steep penalties. Luckily, there are several ways to pay your taxes, including online, by mail, or in person. For more information on how to pay your San Jose property taxes, visit the City of San Jose website.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-pay-my-property-taxes-in-installments-in-San-Jose"><a href="#Can-I-pay-my-property-taxes-in-installments-in-San-Jose" class="headerlink" title="Can I pay my property taxes in installments in San Jose?"></a>Can I pay my property taxes in installments in San Jose?</h1><p>There are a few ways that you can pay your property taxes in installments in San Jose. You can either pay them through your mortgage company, the county, or a private company.</p>
<p>If you are paying your property taxes through your mortgage company, they will often break the payment down into 12 or even 10 installments, which makes it easier for you to budget. However, be aware that if you do this, you may have to pay a higher interest rate on your loan.</p>
<p>The county also offers installment plans for those who don’t want to go through a mortgage company. The plans are available for those who owe $2,500 or less in property taxes and the payments can be as low as $25 per month. However, there is a $12 monthly service charge and you will also need to have a bank account so the funds can be automatically withdrawn.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to go through a mortgage company or the county, there are also private companies that offer installment plans. One such company is San Jose Property Tax Services. They offer plans for both residential and commercial property owners and the payments can be spread out over either 6 or 12 months. They also have no set-up or administrative fees and no minimum payment requirement.</p>

In order to get your property back, you must then pay the winning bidder’s price plus any fees associated with the auction. If you do not pay this amount, the government will keep your property and sell it again at a later date.</p>
