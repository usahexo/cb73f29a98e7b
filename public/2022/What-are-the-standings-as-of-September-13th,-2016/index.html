        <h1 id="What-are-the-standings-as-of-September-13th-2016"><a href="#What-are-the-standings-as-of-September-13th-2016" class="headerlink" title="What are the standings as of September 13th, 2016?"></a>What are the standings as of September 13th, 2016?</h1><p>The current baseball standings as of September 13th, 2016 are as follows:</p>
<p>In the American League (AL), the Toronto Blue Jays are in first place with a record of 87-64. The Baltimore Orioles are in second place with a record of 83-68. The Boston Red Sox are in third place with a record of 78-74. The New York Yankees are in fourth place with a record of 75-76. And the Tampa Bay Rays are in fifth place with a record of 71-81.</p>
<p>In the National League (NL), the San Francisco Giants are in first place with a record of 87-63. The Los Angeles Dodgers are in second place with a record of 85-66. The Washington Nationals are in third place with a record of 81-70. The New York Mets are in fourth place with a record of 79-73. And the Miami Marlins are in fifth place with a record of 77-75.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-odds-for-the-Washington-Nationals-winning-the-division"><a href="#What-are-the-odds-for-the-Washington-Nationals-winning-the-division" class="headerlink" title="What are the odds for the Washington Nationals winning the division?"></a>What are the odds for the Washington Nationals winning the division?</h1><p>The Nationals are the clear favorites to win the NL East this season. Baseball Prospectus (BP) gives them a 77 percent chance of winning the division, with the second-place Phillies given just a 20 percent chance.</p>
<p>This is largely due to the Nats’ projected roster, which is among the best in baseball. Led by Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer, Washington has an excellent mix of hitting and pitching. Other key players include Anthony Rendon, Ryan Zimmerman, Trea Turner, and Stephen Strasburg.</p>
<p>Washington finished with a 97-65 record last season, good for first place in the NL East. They went on to lose in the NLDS to the Cubs. With most of their players returning and some offseason additions, the Nationals are poised for another strong season.</p>
<p>The Phillies made some significant offseason moves, acquiring Jake Arrieta and Carlos Santana. However, they still lack the overall talent of Washington. New York and Atlanta both made some improvement this winter but are still far behind the Nationals.</p>
<p> barring any major injuries, Washington looks like a lock to win their division this year. Their only potential competition comes from Philadelphia, but even the Phillies are unlikely to be able to overtake Washington.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-in-first-place-for-the-National-League-East"><a href="#Who-is-in-first-place-for-the-National-League-East" class="headerlink" title="Who is in first place for the National League East?"></a>Who is in first place for the National League East?</h1><p>The National League East is a competitive division with many teams vying for the top spot. Currently, the Washington Nationals are in first place. However, the Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, and Philadelphia Phillies are all within striking distance. Let’s take a look at each team’s chances of winning the division.</p>
<p>Washington Nationals</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals currently have the best record in the National League East and are in first place. They are led by superstar Bryce Harper and solid pitching from Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. The Nationals’ bullpen has also been strong this season. They should be able to hold on to first place and win the division.</p>
<p>Atlanta Braves</p>
<p>The Atlanta Braves are in second place and just a few games behind the Nationals. They are led by rookie phenom Ronald Acuna Jr. and veterans Freddie Freeman and Nick Markakis. The Braves have a good mix of young talent and experienced players. They should be able to catch up to the Nationals and win the division.</p>
<p>Miami Marlins</p>
<p>The Miami Marlins are in third place but only 5 games back of the Nationals. They are led by Giancarlo Stanton and JT Realmuto. However, they have been struggling lately and may not have enough time to catch up to the Nationals.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Phillies</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Phillies are in last place but only 8 games back of the Nationals. They are led by veteran stars like Jake Arrieta, Rhys Hoskins, and Carlos Santana. They have some young talent as well but may not have enough time to make a playoff run.</p>
<h1 id="What-team-is-in-last-place-for-the-National-League-East"><a href="#What-team-is-in-last-place-for-the-National-League-East" class="headerlink" title="What team is in last place for the National League East?"></a>What team is in last place for the National League East?</h1><p>The last place team for the National League East is currently the Miami Marlins. They are in the midst of a rebuild and are looking to young players to carry them in the future. Some of their top prospects include outfielder Lewis Brinson and catcher Jorge Alfaro. While they may not be contenders this season, they should be exciting to watch in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="When-does-the-regular-season-end-for-the-National-League-East"><a href="#When-does-the-regular-season-end-for-the-National-League-East" class="headerlink" title="When does the regular season end for the National League East?"></a>When does the regular season end for the National League East?</h1><p>As of September 16th, the regular season for the National League East will end on September 30th. This leaves 15 days for teams in the division to battle it out for the chance to make it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals are currently in first place with a 85-54 record, giving them a seven game lead over the Atlanta Braves. Washington seems to be in control of their own destiny at this point, but with 15 games left anything can happen.</p>
<p>The Braves are in second place with a 78-61 record and still have a shot at making the playoffs if they can catch up to the Nationals. However, they would need some help from other teams in order to make that happen.</p>
<p>In third place is the Philadelphia Phillies with a 66-77 record. They are almost out of contention for a playoff spot and will most likely not make it this year.</p>
<p>Fourth place is held by the New York Mets with a record of 63-79. They are also out of the playoff race and will not be making it to October baseball this year.</p>
<p>Last and unfortunately least is the Miami Marlins with only a 59-82 record. They are officially out of playoff contention and have no chance of making it to postseason play this year.</p>
