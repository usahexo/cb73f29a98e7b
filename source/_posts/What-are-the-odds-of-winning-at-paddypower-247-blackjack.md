# What are the odds of winning at paddypower 247 blackjack?

According to the Paddy Power website, the odds of blackjack are between 97% and 98%. This means that if you were to play blackjack at Paddy Power for an infinite amount of time, you would on average lose 2% of your money. So, if you were to bet €100 on blackjack at Paddy Power, you can expect to lose on average €2 over the long term.

However, these odds are not fixed, and they can change depending on the game being played and the rules in place. In general, the odds will be slightly in favour of the casino, but there are some variations that can give players a better chance of winning. For example, games with fewer decks tend to have better odds for players, as there is less opportunity for the casino to gain an advantage.

Players can also improve their winning chances by following a few simple tips. Firstly, always stick to basic blackjack strategy – this will help you make better decisions about when to hit or stand, and will reduce the house edge. Secondly, be aware of which games offer the best odds – again, games with fewer decks tend to be more favourable for players. Finally, remember that it’s important to have fun while playing – even if you don’t win every game, it’s still enjoyable to play!

# Is there a bonus for getting 21?

When you play blackjack in a casino, the goal is to beat the dealer. You win if your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand, without going over 21. If both you and the dealer have the same total, it is called a “push” and you neither win nor lose money.

In blackjack, as in most other casino games, you can make a bet on whether you will win or lose. The casino also makes a bet on the same thing–that the player will lose. In order for the casino to make money in the long run, its edge must be greater than that of the player.

Casinos accomplish this by following a few simple rules: they deal more cards to the dealer than they do to the player, and they take into account the fact that the player has two chances to get closer to 21 than the dealer (before and after splitting). In addition, casinos forbid players from doubling down on certain hands.

These rules give the house an advantage of about 1.5% over players who do not know what they are doing. However, for those who understand basic strategy, this advantage can be reduced to about 0.5%. This means that if you use proper strategy, you can expect to lose about 50 cents for every $100 that you wager in the long run.

Some casinos offer a bonus for getting 21 with two cards (a “blackjack”). However, since this only happens about once every 21 hands, it is not worth counting on explicitly in your betting strategy.
