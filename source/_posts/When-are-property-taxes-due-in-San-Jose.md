#  Can I pay my property taxes in installments in San Jose?

There are a few ways that you can pay your property taxes in installments in San Jose. You can either pay them through your mortgage company, the county, or a private company.

If you are paying your property taxes through your mortgage company, they will often break the payment down into 12 or even 10 installments, which makes it easier for you to budget. However, be aware that if you do this, you may have to pay a higher interest rate on your loan.

The county also offers installment plans for those who don't want to go through a mortgage company. The plans are available for those who owe $2,500 or less in property taxes and the payments can be as low as $25 per month. However, there is a $12 monthly service charge and you will also need to have a bank account so the funds can be automatically withdrawn.

If you don't want to go through a mortgage company or the county, there are also private companies that offer installment plans. One such company is San Jose Property Tax Services. They offer plans for both residential and commercial property owners and the payments can be spread out over either 6 or 12 months. They also have no set-up or administrative fees and no minimum payment requirement.

#  What happens if I don't pay my property taxes in San Jose?

In San Jose, California, if you do not pay your property taxes, the government will auction off your property to the highest bidder.
