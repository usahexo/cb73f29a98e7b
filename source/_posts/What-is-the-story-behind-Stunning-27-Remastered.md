#  What is the story behind Stunning 27 Remastered?

A few months ago, a demo for Stunning 27 Remastered was released on the internet. It was an unfinished game that many people were looking forward to. A year ago, the same demo was released, but it was quickly taken down by the developers. The game looked beautiful and many people were excited for its release.

However, after the recent release of the demo, many people were disappointed. The graphics were worse than the original demo and the gameplay was terrible. Some people even claimed that it was an early access game rather than a remastered game.

So what happened? Why did the graphics get worse and why was the gameplay so terrible?

The answer is actually quite simple. The developers never intended to release a remastered version of Stunning 27. They only ever released the original demo in order to get funding for their new project. However, after seeing how popular the demo became, they decided to release a remastered version in order to make more money.

However, they never actually finished the game and it’s clear that they rushed its development in order to release it before Christmas. As a result, the graphics are worse and the gameplay is terrible.

So if you were looking forward to playing Stunning 27 Remastered, I’m sorry to say that you’ll be disappointed. It’s nothing more than a scam created by some unscrupulous developers.
